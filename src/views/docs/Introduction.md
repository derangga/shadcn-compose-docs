Welcome to the documentation for this unofficial **Jetpack Compose UI** library. Inspired by the clean, modern aesthetic of Shadcn UI, this library brings a collection of reusable and highly customizable components to the Android platform.

This project is a **100% open-source** effort and is not affiliated with the official [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Our goal is to provide developers with a similar, unopinionated foundation for building beautiful, accessible Android applications using Jetpack Compose. The library is designed to be easily integrated into your projects by simply adding it to your Gradle dependencies, giving you seamless access to all the components.
